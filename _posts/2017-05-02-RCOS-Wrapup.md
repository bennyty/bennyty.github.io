This is my final post as both a student and member of the Rensselaer Center for Open Source. I learned so many things as a member including but not limited to: JavaScript, Node, dependency management, in-depth version control, the importance of licensing, time management, Swift, Xcode/iOS development, machine learning, web development, embedded development, and Linux server management.

The club and environment also inspired me to look deeper into open source technology as well as companion ideologies (see Bill Puka's Anarchism and Ethics course.)

This semester I was able to continue working with the National Institutes of Health to bring a state of the art driving data collection platform to the open source market. This semester I primarily worked with my coworkers to add an in-app mapping and navigation feature to allow users to drive with directions while collecting valuable research data.

I am extremely grateful to RCOS for all the support that I receive from them personally as well as professionally.
